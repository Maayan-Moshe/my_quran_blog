            My reading of the Quran
          </h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            This blog is a personal project where I document my impressions and understanding of the Quran as I read through its chapters.
            It is intended to bring my understanding of the book as it is without any scholarly interpretation or external commentary.
            I am bringing my own perspective as I read and reflect on the verses. 
            I am a Hebrew native speaker and learning Arabic, so my reflections are also influenced by my language journey.
            Also I have quite extensive background in Jewish texts and thought, which inevitably shapes my approach to the Quran.

            Purpose
          </h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            This blog is intended to fulfill a few purposes. Some personal, some communal, and some political.
            <ul>
              <li>On a personal level, it helps me process and understand the Quran as I read it.</li>
              <li>On a communal level, I hope it can serve as a resource for others who are interested in the Quran from a fresh perspective.</li>
              <li>Politically, as a Jewish person engaging deeply with the Quran, I wish to understand the relation of the current muslims, arabs and palestinians towards jews. 
                More specifically the relation to independent Jewish existence i.e. Israel.</li>
            </ul>

            Background
          </h3>
          I believe that the Quran is not divine rather a human creation.
          Therefore my reading is not one of faith but of literary and historical interest.
          Moreover, I approach the Quran with the believe that it is heavily based on the Jewish tradition, Hebrew Bible and New Testament.
          Thus I often draw parallels and contrasts between these texts and the Quran in my reflections.

        <strong>Note:</strong> These are personal reflections and interpretations. 
        Contemporary Islamic scholarship and traditional exegesis are not the focus here.
