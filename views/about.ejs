            My Journey with the Quran

            This blog is a personal space where I document my journey through the Holy Quran. 
            As I read and reflect on each Surah (chapter), I share my impressions, insights, 
            and the lessons that resonate with me.

            Purpose
          </h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            The Quran is a book of profound wisdom and guidance. My goal is to slow down, 
            contemplate its verses, and understand their relevance to our lives today. 
            These reflections are purely personal and represent my ongoing learning process.
